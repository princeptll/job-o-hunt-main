📚 About the Project

This project was developed during my college academic period as part of hands-on learning and the practical implementation of core concepts 🛠️.
The main objective was to understand real-world problem solving by applying theoretical knowledge in a structured and practical manner 💡.
Through this project, I strengthened my fundamentals, improved my logical thinking, and gained valuable experience in project planning, development, and execution 🚀.
